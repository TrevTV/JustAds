A recreation of the Cyberpunk 2077 TV channel, Just Ads as a website.

## Why?
I like the ads in Cyberpunk and I thought this was a cool idea, so here we are.

## Where?
An active instance is running at [justads.digital](https://justads.digital).

## Preferences
There are a few options available in the preferences tab.

- Use [Raw/AI Upscaled] Ads **[Defaults to AI Upscaled]**
  - The original videos when ripped from the game are low resolution so to make things look nicer I upscaled each ad to 4K. If you want the lower quality versions of these videos, toggle this option.
- [Hide/Show] Network Bug **[Default to Show]**
  - Toggles the Just Ads! logo at the top right of the video player
- Wallpaper **[Defaults to first]**
  - When I was digging through the game, I found a bunch of laptop wallpapers, so I just threw them all up as options. The first four use the same color scheme while the last 4 each have unique color schemes for the UI.

## Hosting
For simplicity (and that I don't know anything about web development), I kept everything simple by just using vanilla HTML and JavaScript. This does make the code a lot messier, but I'm sure there are people who would know how to do things better so if you want to improve things throw me a PR!
